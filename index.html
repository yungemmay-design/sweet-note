    <h1>💌 A Little Note Just for You 💌</h1>
    <p>
      Hey, <br> <br>

I don’t usually write letters this fast after meeting someone,
but here we are — you must have made quite an impression. I’m still 
trying to figure out whether it was your smile, your vibe, or just the 
way you made the room feel lighter (definitely wasn’t the lighting, I checked).<br>

So let’s get to the real talk… are you single and ready to mingle, or do I need to 
put my “smooth talk” back in storage? 😏 <br>

Also, be honest with me — when you first saw me, what went through your mind? (I’m hoping 
it was something like “Wow, he looks like he knows where the best jollof is,” but I’ll take 
whatever truth you give me).<br>

Anyway, I won’t keep this too long, because I’d rather save some of my charm for when we meet 
again. Just know I enjoyed meeting you, and I’d like to keep that going. <br>

Stay amazing, <br> 
Emmay Gram <br>
